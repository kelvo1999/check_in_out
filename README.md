1. User Roles in the System
We’ll have different types of users interacting with the system:

Admin – Manages the system, registers students, and oversees logs.
Staff (Security/Receptionist) – Handles student check-ins/check-outs.
Parents – Receive SMS notifications when their child enters or leaves school.
Students – Scan their fingerprint to register their movement.
2. System Workflow (Step-by-Step)
🔹 Student Registration
The admin logs in and registers a new student with:
Student Name
Student ID
Class/Form
Parent’s Contact (for SMS)
The student’s fingerprint is scanned and saved in the system (we’ll integrate this later using the ZKTeco SDK).
🔹 Check-In Process (Student Arriving at School)
The student scans their fingerprint on the ZKTeco scanner.
The system verifies the fingerprint and matches it to the student’s record.
If verified:
The check-in time is recorded in the database.
An SMS is sent to the parent:
"Hello [Parent’s Name], your child [Student’s Name] has checked in at [Time]."
If not verified, an error is displayed.
🔹 Check-Out Process (Student Leaving School)
The student scans their fingerprint again when leaving.
The system verifies the fingerprint.
If verified:
The check-out time is recorded.
An SMS is sent to the parent:
"Hello [Parent’s Name], your child [Student’s Name] has checked out at [Time]."
If not verified, an error is displayed.
3. Core Features of the Web App
To make this system work, we need the following pages:

🔸 Login Page
Allows admins and staff to log in.
Redirects to the dashboard after successful authentication.
🔸 Dashboard
Shows recent check-ins/check-outs.
Displays total students present vs. absent.
🔸 Student Management
Add, update, and delete student records.
Assign parents’ contact details for notifications.
🔸 Check-In/Check-Out Page
This will be the main interface for scanning fingerprints (once we integrate ZKTeco).
If no fingerprint scanner is available yet, allow manual check-in via buttons.
🔸 SMS Notification System
Automatically sends SMS alerts to parents when students check in/out.
Will be implemented using an SMS API (we’ll choose the best one later).
🔸 Reports & Logs
View a list of all student movements.
Filter by date, student name, or class.
Export attendance reports (PDF, Excel, etc.).
4. Database Structure (MySQL)
We’ll need at least these tables:

🗃️ students Table
Column	Type	Description
id	INT (PK)	Unique student ID
name	VARCHAR	Student’s full name
class	VARCHAR	Class/Form
parent_phone	VARCHAR	Parent’s phone number
fingerprint_id	INT	Linked to fingerprint data
🗃️ attendance Table
Column	Type	Description
id	INT (PK)	Unique record ID
student_id	INT (FK)	Links to the students table
check_in_time	TIMESTAMP	Time student arrived
check_out_time	TIMESTAMP	Time student left school
🗃️ users Table (for Admins/Staff)
Column	Type	Description
id	INT (PK)	Unique user ID
username	VARCHAR	Login username
password	VARCHAR	Hashed password
role	VARCHAR	admin or staff
5. Tech Stack
We’ll build the system using: ✅ PHP & MySQL (Backend & Database)
✅ HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Frontend)
✅ ZKTeco SDK (For fingerprint scanning)
✅ SMS API (To send notifications)

6. Next Steps
Since we’re doing this in two phases (web app first, then fingerprint integration), here’s what we can start with: ✅ Build the login system
✅ Create student registration & management
✅ Set up the check-in/check-out page (manual first, fingerprint later)
✅ Design SMS notification functionality (integrate API later)
✅ Develop attendance reports
